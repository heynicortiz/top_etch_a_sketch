## Etch-a-Sketch
This is an Etch-a-Sketch style toy written in Javascript which allows users to "draw" on the canvas using their mouse.

Users can adjust the number of "pixels" in the grid, toggle grid-lines, and choose colors to draw with.

## The Odin Project
I completed this as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) as I work to learn JavaScript and improve on my prior web experience with HTML, CSS, and only borrowed scripts!
